# ALGE _flow_

A project started in a grad school class about designing learning environments.  This was my final project for the class.  I had to apply principals of successful learning environments to an environment of my own.  I chose an Algebra classroom, and I was inspired by graphical programming languages used to introduce programming to children.  As a result, I created this prototype of a drag-n-drop interaction for students to learn about order of operations in solving Algebraic equations.
